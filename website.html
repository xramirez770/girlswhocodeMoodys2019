<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>He watched as the creature grabbed Olivia by the neck and swung her bruised, limp body to the side and reached for the girl. The girl couldn’t find it in her to scream or even run away from it. Her expression was a somber one, almost accepting of her faith, as she took in the appearance of it. Its human resemblance was uncanny, but the lumps on its back gave away its inhumanity. The helmet that surrounded its head made it difficult to see what was behind it, only the reflection of crumbling buildings and bright fires that colored the dark sky. You could even see people running in panic while they were shot at by their unseen aggressors. Buildings exploding and crumbling with people still trapped inside. The girl saw as her friends and family were killed and she was ready to die to when the creature pressed its gun to her head and fired.

<p>Ezra’s eyes flew open. What the hell had that been? He pushed himself up on his elbows and swung the covers off him. It was still dark. The clock on his bedside table read three thirty-four. He got up and made his way to the kitchen to get a glass of water. His feet padded through the cold concrete floor of his apartment and disrupted the silence of the night.
This was the fourth night that he had a restless sleep. Every nightmare was the same scene, but from different points of view. The first time it was from Olivia’s perspective, he still shuddered when he remembered how she had begged for her life only to be strangled and then tossed aside. He hadn’t told anyone about his nightmares yet because he loved Olivia too much to tell her there was something wrong with him and he didn’t want his friends to send him to the Asylum; he already worked there, he didn’t need to be another patient.
<p>Unfortunately, Olivia took Ezra's unwillingness to share the wrong way. She thought that Ezra was hiding something from here and in return she was becoming cold with him. There was tension between them when they were together. There conversations were no longer joyous, but awkward and distant. Ezra thought that the nightmares were insignificant, but the rate at which he had been having them lately was alarming.
He made his way back to his room with the water in his hand. Ezra’s steps had woken up Max, his loyal Fox Terrier. Max lifted his head up from his bed and looked up at Ezra as if asking, “Why are you awake at this time? Go back to sleep!”
“Come here boy. Let’s go back to bed,” said Ezra as he patted his thigh.
Instead of sleeping, Ezra placed his water on his bedside and turned on the TV. After his nightmare, he didn’t want to close his eyes again only to continue his nightmare. He flipped mindlessly through the channels until he landed on the news.

<p>“ Tomorrow’s forecast is on the warm side, looks like plenty of sunshine here in Seattle…”</p>

<p>At seven o'clock Ezra got up and started to get ready for school. As a mechanical engineer major, Ezra often had to get his hands dirty, but today he didn’t have to wear his usual uniform and work boots. He wanted to wear something light today, it was going to be sunny. He put on a white t-shirt under a flannel along with a pair of light wash jeans he had shoved into the back of his closet. Olivia had given them to him for their 1-year anniversary and he’d only worn them twice before. Ezra didn’t not like the jeans, but they weren’t as comfortable as his uniform.</p>

<p>He went into the bathroom to attempt to tame his curls, and when his efforts were useless, he just combed them back with his fingers. He said good-bye to Max and jumped into his 1973 Buick Centurion. He had built it himself. It took Ezra a good two years to finish it, and he was damn proud of it. It still needed a little work, however. The motor would shut down at times, but it wasn’t anything that he couldn’t fix in his garage.
Ezra drove down the freeway and onto campus. This was his third year at university, not bad for a seventeen-year old. When he was fourteen he entered and won a robotics competition at Seattle University. The chancellor was impressed and offered him a spot in the university. Ezra’s mom was reluctant at first, but after much nagging from Ezra, she gave in. There, Ezra studied but he also developed tech and worked on machines.</p>

<P>“ ‘Bout time you got here Ezra!” It was Marcus. He had been Ezra’s best mate since he his freshman year. They had a couple classes together, but Marcus was majoring in computer engineering. Next to him stood Olivia.</p>

<p>“Yeah, sorry I took long, I didn’t get much sleep last night, or this past week.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look so good. You should go to the doctor like I've  been telling you to and get yourself checked out,” said Olivia as she stepped towards him and lifted a hand up to touch his face. Her actions displayed worry, but her eyes were distant and her mouth was pressed into a small frown. Part of the reason he didn’t want to tell her about his nightmares was because she worried too much about him. Ezra wanted to care for her, not have her care for him.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” Ezra told her, knowing damn well he wouldn’t. And apparently Olivia knew too, because she gave him a disapproving look.
Ezra grabbed Olivia’s hand and led her to their English class with Marcus trailing behind. Ezra could care less about the class, but Olivia insisted he attend so that he wouldn’t miss on any credits. Besides, this was the only setting in which Ezra could interact with Olivia without being awkward. Ezra only listened to half of what the professor said. He was too busy staring at Olivia and her olive complexion. He loved the way she tucked her short hair back behind her ear when she was deep in thought. He could never get enough of her hazel eyes and how they sparkled when she smiled, especially when that smile was directed at him. He loved her, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. Seeing how things were in their relationship lately, that future seemed less likely everyday.</p>

<p>“Penny for your thoughts?” Olivia’s soft voice disrupted Ezra’s thoughts.</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking, what did I do to deserve such a beautiful girlfriend?”</p>

<p>Olivia blushed when he said that and responded, “You’re just lucky.” Ezra chuckled and turned his focus back to the lecture.</p>

<p>When class was over, Ezra and Olivia said goodbye to Marcus and headed towards downtown. Ezra chose to go to the library which had outside seating. The sun was still bright in the sky, a strange sight in rainy Seattle. The light brought a new life to the city. The buildings looked taller, the people seemed hopeful. The trees were greener and light danced off the damp grass. Ezra had asked Olivia out in hopes of gaining points and begin to make amends with her. He know he wasn't being fair and wanted to make it up to her. He was surprised when she had accepted his invitation, he was sure she was going to deny him.</p>

<p>“Take a seat while I go inside to get our books real quick,” Ezra told Olivia. She took a seat at the table nearest to sidewalk. Ezra knew that Olivia loved to see the streets and scenery as she studied or read. Fairy lights hung from a cedar pergola decorated with vines. The day was just perfect. Ezra finished getting the books for the both of them inside and went back to sit with Olivia.</p>

<p>“So, how’s your week been so far?” Ezra asked, trying to make conversation. If all went well, things with Olivia wouldn’t be as awkward anymore.</p>

<p>“It’s been great, actually. I just got my first assignment from my job at city hall. I have to find a new use for the tunnels underground that are no longer in use. I was thinking we could reinstall the transportation system but make it more modern, you know? I don’t know really. I have three days to think about it and then present my idea to the council.”</p>

<p>“That’s awesome. Who would’ve thought you’d be working for the city at the age of seventeen already?”</p>

<p>“I know, I’m so psyched about it! It’s a little stressful, though. I don’t want to look like a fool when I present.”</p>

<p>“You’re gonna be great, I’m sure of it. And if you want, I can go with you to your presentation. I’ll sit with the audience and cheer you on.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’re gonna have time though, Mister Busy? You don’t have some sort of meeting or anything that you’re not telling me about either?” Olivia was being salty, and Ezra felt his plans begin to foil.</p>

<p>Olivia looked at Ezra suspiciously, “Yeah, you stopped being a good boyfriend two months ago.”</p>

<p>“Olivia, I’m trying to make amends here. I really want to be there for you.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” She was warming up to the idea now,” It’ll help me calm my nerves.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I promise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the best!” Olivia got up and gave Ezra a quick hug that wrapped around him like a blanket. Damn, he had missed her affection. He was going to do his best to be there for Olivia and not let her down.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>The three days that had passed were torture for Ezra. He had waited for what seemed like eternity to see Olivia. Today, he was going to accompany Olivia to her presentation in front the city council. For the first time in weeks Ezra had slept peacefully, thinking about what the day he was going to spend with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do Max? I’m losing Olivia more and more everyday, and it’s all my goddamn fault! How do I tell her I have dreams in which she dies? ‘Hey Olivia, I’m sorry I’ve been distant lately, I’ve been having dreams in which you are brutally murdered by a monster. Can we just put this all behind us and act as if nothing happened?’ She’s going to think I’m crazy and then dump me for sure! What do you think, buddy?”
Max stared back at Ezra, not understanding a word he had said, but feeling his pain. He got up from his place on the floor and curled up on Ezra’s lap, trying to offer comfort. Ezra patted his dog’s head affectionately, appreciating the gesture.</p>

<p>“I just want things to be okay between us again. I miss spending my afternoons with her at the library. Her face would always light up when she talked about the new projects she was working on. Now that trust is going away.” Ezra looked down at Max. He was looking back up at him. Max did the only thing he could and let out a single whine, accompanying Ezra in his heartbreak.</p>

<p>In the Asylum, Ezra was a friend to his patients. He was particularly fond of Ben, a man in his late seventies. Ezra would sit and talk with Ben for hours without end. Ben would tell Ezra stories about the world during his time. Humans were developing the latest technology, society was thriving, but then came the Annihilation. Whenever Ben began to talk about the Annihilation, Ezra knew that it was time to put Ben to sleep. The doctors had diagnosed Ben with psychosis, so he often rambled about his delusions, like the Annihilation.</p>

<p>“C’mon Ben, it’s time to go to bed.”

<p>“B-but, hold on! I’m not done with my story yet! You always change the subject when I start talking about this. Disrespectful child! Don’t you know that I am an Elder, you should be begging to hear these stories. As I was saying, the people had turned against each other. Brother against brother. Father against son. They were fighting like animals straight out of the wild. No one was safe! Only those that had the technology inside them to survive did, and they did so amazingly. They defeated those that opposed them, and drove them of Earth. Together, they reconstructed society and forgot what they had done, and moved on with their lives. It’s true, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Sure, Ben. Now come on, let’s get you sleeping.”

<p>Ben looked at Ezra straight in the eyes and said,“One of these days, son, you’ll see that what I’m telling you is true. I am one of the survivors, and so are you. We have something special inside us, and when you figure it out, it’ll be too late.”</p>

<p>Ezra agreed with the man just to satisfy the old man, but he had to admit, the way Ben had looked at him planted a seed of doubt in his mind. What if what part of what Ben had said was true? Was there something special inside him? If so, what was it?
Ezra finished tucking Ben into bed and left him room. As he closed the door, he couldn’t stop thinking about the short, balding man and his words. He made his way down to the Asylum's basement to get some towels for the other patients. He walked down the dark stairs and reached the bottom. The basement was very poorly lit with dim ceiling lights barley illuminating the room. As Ezra made his way to the towels, he noticed that one of the fluorescent desk lamps were flickering. He stared at it, watching the light shift from dark to bright light. The light triggered something in the back of his brain. Ezra began to feel light-headed and his vision began to blur. Next thing he knew, he had passed out.</p>
***
<p>Ezra stood on a stool trying to fix the light. The light had been flickering for a while now. He finished and made his way  down the ladder and as he reached down to pick up his tools, he looked up at the large television in the middle of the large lobby. On the screen there was a political debate about the Others.</p>

<p>“They are a menace to our society. If we let them coexist with us it will lead to an inevitable revolution, causing the end of mankind!”</p>

<p>“But you also have to look at the other side of the story. This could mean a new future for us. They can help us discover things about the universe that we’ve been struggling to know about for centuries! The origin of the universe, if there’s other life out in space, the possibilities are endless!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right, a future in which humanity is obsolete and they reign over the cosmos!”</p>

<p>Ezra’s vision then shifted. Now, he was panting as he ran for his life away from the armed guards. He kept looking back as he ran, the uniformed man still chasing after him as he tried to shoot Ezra. All of a sudden, bullets started penetrating the glass windows on the corridor that Ezra was running through. He raised his hand to cover his face as he continued running. He also noticed that his other hand was holding onto someone else, and it felt so familiar. He looked to his left and saw Olivia, panting as she tried to keep up with him, trying to evade the bullets.</p>
***
<p>Ezra woke up face down on the cold basement floor. Ezra got up slowly, trying to take in his surroundings. What the hell had happened? He had come down to get towels, but he didn’t remember anything after that. He looked down at his watch. Holy shit! It was six in the afternoon! He had completely missed Olivia’s presentation! Oh god, she was going to kill him. He had waited a thousand years to feel like his relationship with Olivia was healing, but he had gone and thrown it all away. Ezra had no other option than to go to Olivia’s house and apologize.</p>
***
<p>“I’m so sick of you shit, Ezra!” Olivia was livid. “You’re not honest with me, you don’t want to tell me what’s wrong with you, how the hell am I supposed to keep trusting you? And then you promise to come to my presentation, and I finally think we’re over this rough patch, but no!”  Her cold words cut through Ezra’s heart.</p>
<p>“I know, I’m sorry. I promise you that tomorrow morning, I’ll go to the Clinic and get help.”

<p>“Yeah? And how am I supposed to be sure you’re not lying to me again? How can I trust that you’re not trying to trick me? I feel like I don’t even know you anymore. I just don’t think I can take anymore of this.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying? Of course you can trust me. I know I haven’t been fair to you, but you have to trust that I’m doing this for your own good.”</p>

<p>“For my own good? If you actually cared you wouldn’t be putting me through all this pain! I don’t know why you just won’t tell me what’s wrong!”</p>

<p>“I just… I have my reasons Olivia. I don’t want you to get hurt anymore. I promise, I’ll look for help first thing tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Well for the sake of us, I  hope you do.”</p>
